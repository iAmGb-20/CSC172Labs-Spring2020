LAB8
For this lab, we implemented various methods for the sorting algorithms indicated in the homework.
The main method was responsible for all running the sorting algorithms.
Our methods included bubble sort, insertion sort, shell sort along with the library sort algorithms.

Extra stuff.
We implemented the quicksort algorithm which was marked as a question in our lab for extra credit.

Along with this, please find the PDF file that contains the results of our sorting algorithm.


Thank you for your time.
