In this lab, we implemented Graphs Class from Lab11 and modified it to contain three more methods:unweighted and createFromFile and printPath

The unweighted method takes in integer value s which is the starting vertex. This method is responsible for implementing the unweighted shortest path algorithm. The pseudocode given in the lab is used.

The printPath method takes in an integer value p which is the ending of the path we want to find. 

createFromFile(String filename) takes in the name of the text file which has an input in a given order(1st enter num of vertices,U or D based on whether directed or undirected and then the edges). We use this method to create the appropriate Graph and return the Graph.

The main method calls createFromFile to get the Graph. It is important for the lab TA to enter the names of the different textFiles while running the program on terminal(for example "java Graphs tester.txt" and the next time changing the name of the txtfile.

The Tester files are 3 from the given pdf and 3 that are made up test cases. tester4.txt, tester5.txt and tester6.txt are all test cases from us.


Thank you for your time.
