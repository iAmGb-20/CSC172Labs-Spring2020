In this lab, we implemented a hash function which converted every character in a string to its respective ASCII.
HashTable.java included insert and print methods as instructed by the lab.
This class also contained getter methods for capacity,loadfactor, size and for increasing capacity of the hashtable for the sake of rehashing.
In addition to that, we implemented a rehashing function which ensured that the hashtable's size is incremented whenever the table's size is small

We implemented the main class in which we used a bufferedReader to read through the lorem ipsum text and add it to the hashtable.
