LAB9
We implemented the Heap interface in this lab which had the methods isEmpty,insert,bubble up,printHeap,bubble down,etc
All these methods were implemented as explained in the lab.
The type of heap we implemented was minHeap. That is to say, the parent node contained the smallest element and the last element was the largest.

In addition to that, we implemented getLeftChildIndex: to get the index of the left child,
, getRightChildIndex: to get the index of the right child,
 deleteMin: to delete the minimum element in the heap,
  swap,
  as well as printHeap:prints the entire heap 
  (as additional methods)
they helped in increasing the efficiency of our program.

Thank you for your time!
