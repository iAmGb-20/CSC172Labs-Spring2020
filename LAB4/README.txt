Task 1 required us to show the run time for every line of code in the count function in all the given java files. Please refer to the java files to see how this was implemented
Task 2 required us to draw graphs with the x-axis in a logarithmic scale, the y axis representing the run-time(T(n))
Task 3 required us to estimate the run time for large data sizes like 32Kints.txt and 1Mints.txt. We used the graph itself and came up with the estimates for the respective run times.
We did not finish running 1Mints.txt and 32Kints.txt for three-sum and three-sum fast because it took a lot of time

Please refer to the java files as well as the pdf document to know what we did.


Thank you for your time.
