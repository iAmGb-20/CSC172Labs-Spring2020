Lab: 6:15-7:30pm

In this lab, we implemented a total of four methods based on the given interface.
Please read the comments as written in the source file.
For this lab, I created a linked list of the same type as that of lab5 and added elements to it while using the FIFO
(First-In-First-Out) principle. I simply called the methods, as required by the question. Refer to the source file for 
the description.

In addition to the required, I implemented a variable called sizeofQueue which increased and decreased
as I enqueued and dequeued elements, respectively. I found it useful because it helped me verify that the queue is empty
if all the elements have been dequeued.
